# nbaStatsFun
Individual project for Enterprise Java class.

## Problem Statement

NBA statistics can be very fun and interesting to look at. However, many of
the sites that are out there are either cluttered with information and ads, 
hard to navigate, or don't provide much flexibility in what you can look at. 
This website will allow the user to lookup and track stats for teams and 
players that are interested in. It will also provide the user a way to discover
random stats when something piques their curiosity.
